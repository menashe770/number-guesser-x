<h1> Number Guesser </h1>
<h2> By Menashe Borukhov and Ebenezer Ingalsbe</h2>
<h1> Intro</h1>
<p>
This project was all about recreating a website that has a game on it. The game consists of two players, who each try to guess a random number that gets generated when the user clicks a button. 
</p>
<h1> What we did</h1>
<p>
The site we recreated matches the comp we were given nearly 100% (design and layout). And the game behaves like this: As the page loads, all input fields are empty, and the user is not allowed to create the random # without entering it into the correct field. Then the user/users must choose the range for which the random number is generated. After the range is chosen they must then enter they're names and guesses. When the guesses are submitted, the site responds by telling each user if they're guesses were either too high or two low. And if they get the number correct, it says "Boom!". Each time a user guesses correctly a score card appears on the right (or bottom) part of the page.
